## QR Code School Bus Tracking System
For Youngstown State University's Software Engineering Course (CSCI 5801), our project idea is to create a system for tracking students' pick-up and drop-off times and locations on their busing routes. The plan is to give children QR codes that they cannot easily lose (sewn into backpacks) that the bus drivers can easily scan on their phones' built-in camera app. This will prompt them to allow location detection in the web browser to detect the coordinates of the pick-up or drop-off, and automatically record the time that it occurred. By enabling cookies, the drivers' names can be stored to allow for a quicker scanning process. This could also be extended to school, daycare, or extracurricular staff so that there is confirmation by an adult that the children were not only safely dropped off, but also received by an authority figure. School administrators would have an admin login on the website to ensure that all students were received and their whereabouts accounted for.
