//scan a student, receive dialog box when system caches URL
//if connection to DB slow, kickback a push notification that it failed once validated
//obviously this is not ideal bc the driver might not know who it was that failed but at least its better than not knowing at all

//using qrcodescan.in as inspiration

//use html geolocation upon scan event
//use qr-scanner JS library
